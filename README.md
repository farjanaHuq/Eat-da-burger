# Eat-da-burger

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the 'Your burger' section -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the 'eaten burger' section.

* There is a 'clean up' button -- waiting to be discarded. After the burger is eaten the user would be able to clean up by clicking the 'clean up button'.
